/**
 A Signal represents a type of event that Observable objects implement and fire and Observers listen to. 
 
 Each class that wants to implement the Observable pattern first register the types of events they fire using the CreateSignalType macro. This registers the type of data that is being fired by one of the Signals of the class to ensure type-safety. 
 
 Observable classes then define properties with the naming convention on<EventName> (e.g. onNetworkData, onError, etc.) and use the appropriate type of signal type (e.g UBSignal<NetworkDataSignal>) to delcare its signals.
 
 Observers register themselves to any Signals on instances they are interested in using the addObserver:callback: method of the Signal. Self is usually passed into the observer-parameter. The signal will weakify the observer pass it back to the the callback along with any parameters defined by the type of the Signal whenever the Signal fires. This way users don't have to weakify any references to self themselves and can rest assured that they're not creating retain cycles.
 
 Observable classes fire the signal by retreiving the fire-block of the signal through the fire-property of the signal and calling it with the type of data registered with the Signal.
 
 Signals will also detect deallocations of its observers, so it's not necessary to remove observers from Signals due to lifecycle changes.
